A promising way to further improve outcome in this disease appears to be the development of adjuvant therapeutic strategies. In this research the anti-GD2 antibody, which is a standard treatment, is to be combined with 131-l Metaiodobenzylguanidine (mlBG) and anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibody Nivolumab - the investigated drugs - with the aim of generating sustained anti-neuroblastoma immunity. In particular it will be determined the safety and tolerability of the novel combination as well as documented any evidence of efficacy in paediatric patients with relapsed and refractory high risk neuroblastoma.  This study is sponsored by the University Hospital Southampton and will take place in 4 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Germany and USA.

Such design uses accumulating of data from the ongoing trial to modify aspects of the study (e.g. duration, number of treatments) without undermining its validity or integrity. There will be 3 cohorts of patients. As safety of Nivolumab is well established, Cohort 1 will assess its safety and tolerability in combination with 131-l mlBG. Cohort 2 will then add anti-GD2 to the drug combination, assessing safety and tolerability. Cohort 3 will escalate all 3 agents to the full 100% dose level to assure safety for expanded analyses of clinical and laboratory data at that dose level.  Patients will initially be recruited into Cohort 1. Patients must have completed at least 12 weeks of trial treatment without reaching a Dose Limiting Toxicity before a patient can be recruited to the next cohort.

This research study uses special immune system cells called AGAR T cells, a new experimental treatment.  The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.  Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene (a tiny part of what makes-up DNA and carries your traits) into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In the lab, investigators made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GPC3. The antibody GPC3 recognizes a protein found solid tumors including pediatric liver cancers. This CAR is called GPC3-CAR. To make this CAR more effective, investigators also added a gene that includes IL15. IL15 is a protein that helps CAR T cells grow better and stay in the blood longer so that they may kill tumors better. The mixture of GPC3-CAR and IL15 killed tumor cells better in the laboratory when compared with CAR T cells that did not have IL15 .This study will test T cells that investigators made (called genetic engineering) with GPC3-CAR and the IL15 (AGAR T cells) in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors such as yours.  T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they encounter a specific drug called Rimiducid. The investigators will insert the iCasp9 and IL15 together into the T cells using a virus that has been made for this study. The drug (Rimiducid) is an experimental drug that has been tested in humans with no bad side-effects. The investigators will use this drug to kill the T cells if necessary due to side effects.  This study will test T cells genetically engineered with a GPC3-CAR and IL15 (AGAR T cells) in patients with GPC3-positive solid tumors.  The AGAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
